          A Web framework for contributing alternative narratives to Web content and to compose renditions based on the user's literacy level or reading-comfort preferences. Re-narration Web is modeled as a distributed social networking for the purpose of making Web-content available for a person who is not comfortable reading text or for a person in a foreign context. Individuals contributing to alternative narratives is the key aspect of re-narration Web.

          An individual can choose to provide alternative narration to any specific entity such as an image, a paragraph or subtitles for a segment of a video and such.

          The idea of the re-narration Web is to provide a person visiting a Web page, a comfortable narrative of the page content based on the visitor profile and contributions of alternative narratives made available by the community.
